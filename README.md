# About me
Heya, I'm sadru, a programmer from Czech Republic. I have taken classes on python during 8th grade, since then I have been actively coding. I use mainly python but I want to learn a bit of js. I make mostly api wrappers and downloaders, but I sometimes also make libraries and some smaller projects for school.

If you want to contact me, the best way is through [Discord](https://discord.com/users/454513969265115137) (sadru#1323). I most likely won't take any friends so just join some server I'm in (for example [TPH](https://discord.gg/programming)). My time zone GMT+1.

## My hobbies and school
