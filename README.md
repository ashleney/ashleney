# About me
Heya, I'm sadru, a programmer from Czech Republic. I am still a high school student but I am trying my best to learn as much as I can. I mainly use python but I want to eventually use other, lower level languages.

My goal with every project I make is to make stuff more accessible to other people, be it a fancy downloader or a wrapper around an undocumented api. I love reflection and will not make a project without it.

If you want to contact me or ask me any questions, the best way is through [Discord](https://discord.com/users/454513969265115137) (sadru#5438). I most likely won't take any friends so just join [my own private server](https://discord.gg/sMkSKRPuCR).

## My hobbies and school
I enjoy programming and watching anime. I'm currently in high school and plan on studying computer science. 

## My projects
- [`genshinstats`](https://github.com/thesadru/genshinstats) - An api wrapper around the Genshin Impact api 
- [`genshin.py`](https://github.com/thesadru/genshin.py) - A modern API wrapper for Genshin Impact and Honkai Impact 3rd built on asyncio and pydantic
